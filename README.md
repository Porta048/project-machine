# Predictive Maintenance Project - DEMO VERSION

> **🚧 DEMO VERSION - For Educational and Demonstration Purposes Only**
>
> This is a demonstration version of a predictive maintenance system. While it uses real machine learning techniques and datasets, it is designed for educational purposes and proof-of-concept demonstrations.

## Description

This project implements a **predictive maintenance** system using **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques to predict the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of industrial engines. The project is inspired by the needs of companies like Fincantieri in the shipbuilding industry.

**Demo Features:**
- ✅ Real NASA Turbofan Engine dataset
- ✅ LSTM-based RUL prediction models
- ✅ Web interface with image analysis
- ✅ Simulated sensor data generation
- ⚠️ Results are for demonstration purposes only

## Objective

Predict how many operating cycles remain before an engine fails, allowing to:
- **Optimize scheduled maintenance**
- **Reduce unplanned downtime**
- **Minimize maintenance costs**
- **Increase system reliability**

## Dataset

We use the **NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set**, a public dataset that perfectly simulates industrial sensor data:

- **Training data**: 100 engines with complete readings until failure
- **Test data**: 100 engines to evaluate performance
- **Sensors**: 21 different sensors (temperature, pressure, vibrations, etc.)
- **Operating cycles**: From 128 to 362 cycles per engine

## System Architecture

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Min-Max normalization of sensors
- Creation of temporal sequences for LSTM
- Automatic RUL calculation

### 2. **LSTM Model**
- **Input**: Sequences of 50 operating cycles
- **Architecture**: 2 LSTM layers + Dropout + Dense
- **Output**: RUL prediction (remaining cycles)

### 3. **Evaluation**
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error  
- **R²**: Coefficient of determination

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution
```bash
python manutenzione_predittiva.py
```

## Expected Results

The model should achieve:
- **RMSE**: ~20-30 cycles
- **MAE**: ~15-25 cycles
- **R²**: >0.85

## Demo Disclaimer

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This is a **DEMO VERSION** for educational and demonstration purposes only. 

**Limitations:**
- Simulated sensor data is generated from image analysis
- Results should not be used for actual industrial decisions
- Real-world deployment requires validation with domain-specific data
- Production systems need real sensor integration and safety protocols

**For Production Use:**
- Validate models with real operational data
- Implement proper sensor integration
- Add safety and redundancy systems
- Conduct thorough testing and validation
